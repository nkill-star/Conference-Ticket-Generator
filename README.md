🎟️ Frontend Mentor - Conference Ticket Generator Solution

This is my solution to the Conference Ticket Generator challenge on Frontend Mentor.
This project helped me strengthen my React skills, improve form validation, and practice responsive design.

📌 Overview
A sleek Conference Ticket Generator that allows users to fill out a form and receive a digital conference ticket with their details.

🎯 The Challenge

✅ Users should be able to:

📝 Complete the form with their name, email, GitHub username, and avatar.

🚨 Receive form validation messages if:

Any field is left empty.

The email is not valid.

The avatar exceeds file size or wrong format.

⌨️ Complete the entire form using keyboard navigation.

♿ Ensure inputs, hints, and errors are accessible for screen readers.

🎟️ View the generated conference ticket after successful submission.

📱 Experience a responsive layout across devices.
